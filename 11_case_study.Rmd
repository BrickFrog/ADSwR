# Case Study: Building the *Valuecheck*

My current employer (funda)[https://www.funda.nl/] is the market place for selling and buying homes in the Netherlands.
A long standing company wish was to use the data of recent house sales for predicting the current value of all houses in the Netherlands.
We knew that home owners used the asking prices of neighboring houses published on *funda* to keep track of local market trends.
We wanted to facilitate them to translate the recent sale prices in an official estimate of their specific house.
They no longer had to look at the houses that are offered, out statistical model had already done that.
Moreover, they did not make the translation of offered houses to their own house informally, the model determined which characteristics of a house matters and which not.
A final advantage was that we could use of the selling prices instead of the asking prices, these are not shown on the website.
So the product reflected what their house could be sold for, instead of what the typical asking price of their home was.

To create what eventually would become the *Valuecheck*, a colleague data scientist and me joined an existing Scrum team.
This team comprised two backend developer, a frontend developer, a UX designer, and a product owner. 
We had never worked with an Agile method before and were only vaguely aware of its underpinnings.
In the beginning we experimented with fitting in the data science work into the existing workflow of the team.
