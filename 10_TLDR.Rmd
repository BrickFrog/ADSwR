# TL;DR

A bullet point overview of this text:

Chapter 2

* Agile is a reaction to Waterfall, the standard of doing software development up until the nineties.
* Waterfall is heavy, projects can take years to finish.
* Agile wants to deliver software continuously, improving constantly, instead of one big delivery.
* The *Agile Manifesto* is a set of four values and twelve principles.

Chapter 3

* Workflows are serving the Agile philosophy and are not holy, change them if they don't serve you.
* Scrum works with *sprints*, in which the team commits to a set of tasks to complete in that time.
* Scrum tasks are formulated in *user stories*, that make clear how the completion of it adds value.
* The Scrum roles are: *scrum master*, *product owner*, and *the team*.
* The Scrum ceremonies are: *sprint planning*, *stand-up*, *sprint review*, and *retrospective*.
* In Kanban tasks are gathered on a backlog, the most important task is done next.
* Central metric is the *cycle time*, how long does it last on average to complete a task.
* Scrum is rigid in its commitments and ceremonies, Kanban is flexible.

Chapter 4

* Ineffective workflows are one of the causes that many data science projects are currently failing.
* Early delivery of a minimal product or model will keep stakeholders excited, will make you fail fast and will get you feedback sooner.
* You should work closely with business people, if you want to work effectively.
* Every possible improvement to the product should be deployed right away.
Improvements only count when they have left your system and others can benefit from it.
* Adopt the best practices from software engineering to your data project to assure high-quality code.
* Continuously reflect on the effectiveness of the workflow you are following.
