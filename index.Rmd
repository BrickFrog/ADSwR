# Introduction

Vivid memories sometimes surface, especially at night, of times not too long ago when I was starting my career as a data scientist. Freshly graduated from an applied statistics master I entered the arena of Dutch business employed by a small consulting firm. Neither the company I was working for, nor the clients I was working, nor myself had an understanding of what it meant to implement a statistical model or a machine learning method in the real world. When we finally came to something that looked like a project, I plunged into it. Eager to deliver results quickly I loaded data extracts into R and started to apply all kinds of different models on it. Findings ended up in the code comments of the R scripts, of which many ended up to be hundreds of lines long. To remain somekind of overview I numbered the scripts serially, but this about all the system I had.
