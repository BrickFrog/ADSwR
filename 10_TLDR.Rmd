# TL;DR

A bullet point overview of this text:

Chapter 2

* Agile is a reaction to Waterfall, the standard of doing software development up until the nineties.
* Waterfall is heavy, projects can take years to finish.
* Agile wants to deliver software continuously, improving constantly, instead of one big delivery.
* The *Agile Manifesto* is a set of four values and twelve principles.

Chapter 3

* Workflows are serving the Agile philosophy and are not holy, change them if they don't serve you.
* Scrum works with *sprints*, in which the team commits to a set of tasks to complete in that time.
* Scrum tasks are formulated in *user stories*, that make clear how the completion of it adds value.
* The Scrum roles are: *scrum master*, *product owner*, and *the team*.
* The Scrum ceremonies are: *sprint planning*, *stand-up*, *sprint review*, and *retrospective*.
* In Kanban tasks are gathered on a backlog, the most important task is done next.
* Central metric is the *cycle time*, how long does it last on average to complete a task.
* Scrum is rigid in its commitments and ceremonies, Kanban is flexible.

Chapter 4

* Ineffective workflows are one of the causes that many data science projects are currently failing.
* Early delivery of a minimal product or model will keep stakeholders excited, will make you fail fast and will get you feedback sooner.
* You should work closely with business people, if you want to work effectively.
* Every possible improvement to the product should be deployed right away.
Improvements only count when they have left your system and others can benefit from it.
* Adopt the best practices from software engineering to your data project to assure high-quality code.
* Continuously reflect on the effectiveness of the workflow you are following.

Chapter 5

* Data science is different from regular software engineering, because it needs to exploit yet to be discovered relationships in the data.
* This makes it infeasible to give a tight planning about what will change to the product, as is done in Scrum.
* A two-way workflow is proposed in which a hard split is made between the *product* and *exploratory research*.
* Tasks are added to a Kanban board and are limited on doing exploration or changing the product.
* For exploration it is a good idea to scope tasks as the number of times you can spend on it. 
If there is a need for exploring the subject more after it, create a new task for it. 
* Working Agile is what matters, not adhering to a specific process. If something does not work for your product, change it immediatly.

Chapter 6

* The R package structure is very suitable to organise a two-way workflow with exploration and product.
* Create low level an higher level functions in the package, apply in a pipeline.
* Use Rmarkdown in the Vignettes folder to do data explorations.

Chapter 7

* In the data product as much as possible should be automated.
* Automation saves time and energe in the long run, because the data scientist does not have to rerun the same thing over and over.
* Automation serves as documentation, because it makes clear how the product pieces play together.
* Automation assures reproducibility, if it is not reproducible it will not run.
* R has the fantastic `drake` package for automation.
