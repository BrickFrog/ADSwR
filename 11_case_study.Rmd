# Case Study: Building the *Valuecheck*

My current employer (funda)[https://www.funda.nl/] is the market place for selling and buying homes in the Netherlands.
A long standing company wish was to use the data of recent house sales for predicting the current value of all houses in the Netherlands.
We knew that home owners used the asking prices of neighboring houses published on *funda* to keep track of local market trends.
We wanted to facilitate them to translate the recent sale prices in an official estimate of their specific house.
They no longer had to look at the houses that are offered, out statistical model had already done that.
Moreover, they did not make the translation of offered houses to their own house informally, the model determined which characteristics of a house matters and which not.
A final advantage was that we could use of the selling prices instead of the asking prices, these are not shown on the website.
So the product reflected what their house could be sold for, instead of what the typical asking price of their home was.

To create what eventually would become the *Valuecheck*, a colleague data scientist and me joined an existing Scrum team.
This team comprised of two backend developer, a frontend developer, a UX designer, and a product owner. 

## Trying Scrum

The teams was very experienced with using Scrum and had all the workflows in place, so it made sense to try to fit in our tasks into this framework.
At first this worked out quite well, because the first set of tasks we had to complete were essentially software tasks.
Setting up a server, build a first query so we had a modelling set, splitting into train and test, and doing some data cleaning.
These tasks were scopeable, we could estimate the time we needed to complete them quite accurately and they had a clear definition of done.
Then the model building started and we got more and more trouble fitting the tasks into the tight Scrum methodology.
We could not tell what the model would like in two weeks time, it depended on the relationships we would find in the data.
We certainly could not give estimates what the model quality would be then (measured in a an agreed-upon statistic).

## Moving to Kanban

Having scopeable tasks is essential for building proper Scrum sprints.
As a team you have to commit to what you are going to complete in the upcoming two weeks.
No longer being able to do that, we could not be part of the Scrum rythm anymore.
We found the alternative in moving the data science tasks to a separate Kanban board, stepping out of the Scrum cycles.
We started with
